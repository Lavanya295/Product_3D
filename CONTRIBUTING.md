### :warning: 5. Steps for setting up the environment (Vite + React) :hammer_and_wrench:

Please follow the instructions below carefully:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup :

Find a file named ` .example.env`. This file serves as a template for the environment variables required to run the application. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`in the same directory.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Environment Variables :

Open the newly created `.env` file and update the values of the environment variables according to the platform we're working on (Vite + React). For example, you might need to set environment variables related to Firebase, API keys, or other configurations specific to our project.

Make sure to keep sensitive information, such as API keys and credentials, confidential and avoid committing them to the version control system.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Building the Project :

Once you've added the necessary environment variables, navigate to the `./client` directory in your terminal and run the following command to build the project:

`npm run build`

This command will generate the production-ready optimized build of our application.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Project :

To start the development server and run the application locally, use the following command:

`npm run dev`

### Now go ahead and create a new branch and move to the branch

```
git checkout -b fix-issue-<ISSUE-NUMBER>
```

> **Note**: Replace `<ISSUE-NUMBER>` with the issue number you are working on

> Add new features or fix bugs according to your issue number

# To Push your changes

- `git status -s` (Shows the changed files)
- `git add --all` (Will add all the files to staging area)
- `git commit -m "feat/docs/fix: <EXPLAIN-YOUR_CHANGES>"`
- `git remote add upstream https://github.com/amanjaiman1/Product_3D`
- `git push origin fix-issue-<ISSUE-NUMBER>`

### Commit Message Format

- We follow the conventional commit message format to provide a clear and standardized history of our project's changes. Each commit message should consist of a type and a descriptive message.
  | Type | Heading | Rule | Description |

  | fix | Fix | Bug Fixes | Bug fixes or corrections. |
  | perf | Perf | Performance Improvements | Performance-related improvements. |

# Submitting Pull Requests

- After this go to your forked GitHub repository and go to `Pull Request` section. Now you might be able to see a pop up saying **Pull Request**. Click on the popup and you will be redirected to pull request page

- Now fill in the form template of the pull request and give the necessary description.

- Click on **Submit**

- Hurray! You just made your first contribution to this project üéâ

# Guideline for issues

### Search for Existing Issues:

- Before creating a new issue, search the issue tracker to see if a similar problem or feature request has already been reported. Duplicates can clutter the tracker and make it harder to manage.

### Clear and Descriptive Titles:

- Use a clear and concise title that summarizes the problem or feature. Avoid ambiguous titles and be specific to help others understand the issue's content quickly.

### Detailed Description:

- Provide a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce bugs, expected behavior, and any relevant information about the environment. For feature requests, explain the rationale and use cases.

### Code Samples and Images:

- When applicable, provide code samples, screenshots, or links to relevant sections of the codebase to better illustrate the problem.

### Formatting:

- Use Markdown or any supported formatting language to structure the issue description clearly. Bullet points, lists, and code blocks enhance readability.

# Communication

Effective communication is essential for maintaining a collaborative and inclusive environment. When participating in discussions, please:

- Be respectful and considerate towards others.
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions.
- Clearly express your thoughts and ideas.
- Be open to different perspectives and opinions.
